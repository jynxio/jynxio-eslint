## Overview

This is a loosely styled ESLint configuration that closely follows the style required by the [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) source code. Please refer to the `.eslintrc.json` file for specific configurations.

When I wrote this ESLint configuration, the latest version number of ESLint official was `8.36.0`.
